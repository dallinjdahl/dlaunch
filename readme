dlaunch

This script is a dmenu_run replacement using the execline language
instead of sh.  It also has added support for running programs in the
terminal by simply appending ; to the input.

pkg/install

This script is designed to create a symlink to the dlaunch script in a
location easily appended to the PATH variable.  By default, it creates
the symlink at ../../bin, which assumes an organization similar to
the following:

sys: root for sysadmin files (not necessarily in root)
sys/bin: symlinks to all binaries intended to be run by the end user.
sys/pkg: root for packages, including source code, config, and binaries.
sys/pkg/dlaunch: dlaunch package
